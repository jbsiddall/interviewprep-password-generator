# Password Generator

A simple React-based password generator created as an interview coding challenge solution. The challenge was to create a password generator that allows users to specify:

- Desired password length
- Number of capital letters
- Number of numbers
- Number of symbols

The generator then creates a randomized password meeting these criteria.

## Implementation

see `main.tsx`
